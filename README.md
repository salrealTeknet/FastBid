INTRODUCTION:
My Name Is Salihu  AbdulJawwad, A student and  benefactor of  ALX Africa SE (Software Engineering) scholarship program, Cohort 8. Inline with the current requirement , i will be working on a web project titled Fast Bid.

Challenge:
 Fast Bid is an innovative platform optimized to help connect two or more people together with the product and services, such that they help each other augment sales by helping one another scout for buyers for the same product outside their market scope.

The application is an open  marketplace but basically focuses on sellers to sellers not buyers. With the aid of Mentorship and support i hope to achieve the application by the end of this session 

6. Risks:
Fast Bid framework was adopted from existing online ecommerce platform as such it might take a while and explanation for users to understand the specifications of how it works and conditions for usage.

7. Architecture
This  Platform is an Ecommerce platform basically built for manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, with similar products and services to help sell fast as such there are a lot of existing platforms that cross reference this concept such as Nairaland.com, Facebook.com, Indeed.com, and nigeriapropertypro.ng.
